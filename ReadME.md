**Image Resizing Script**

This is a Python script that resizes images in a source folder and saves them to a destination folder. The script uses the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module to resize the images.

**Installation**

To use this script, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system, as well as the PIL module. You can install PIL by running the following command:

pip install pillow

**Usage**

To use this script, simply modify the source\_folder and destination\_folder variables in the script to specify the location of your source images and where you want the resized images to be saved. Then, run the script using the following command:

python image\_resize.py

This will resize all of the images in the source folder and save them to the destination folder at three different sizes (64x64, 128x128, and 256x256). The resized images will be saved with the same filename as the original image, but with a suffix indicating the size (e.g. \_64.png, \_128.png, or \_256.png).
